# ADR 0003: Improve Keyboard Navigation Accessibility

## Context

While the main page of the Track Manager provides correct keyboard navigation (e.g., tabbing through buttons and inputs), modal dialogs currently do not trap focus properly. When a user presses Tab or Shift+Tab, focus move outside the modal, which breaks expected accessibility behavior. This reduces usability for keyboard-only users and negatively impacts the system's accessibility.

## Decision

We will improve keyboard accessibility by:

1. Implementing proper focus trapping in modal dialogs (focus stays within the modal while open).
2. Using visible focus indicators for all focusable elements (e.g., via `:focus-visible` or outline styles).
3. Auditing all interactive elements to ensure logical and intuitive tab order.
4. Applying consistent keyboard navigation patterns in reusable UI components (e.g., buttons, forms, modals).

These changes will be applied incrementally and will become part of the project‚Äôs component and interaction design standards.

## Rationale

Usability and keyboard accessibility are important non-functional qualities of modern web applications, especially for users who rely on assistive technologies or do not use a mouse.
This decision enhances accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## Status

Proposed

## Consequences

**Positive:**

- Enables full keyboard control across the app
- Improves accessibility and inclusivity
- Improves code clarity and component consistency

**Negative:**

- Refactoring modals and focus management will require additional effort
- Some learning curve involved in implementing proper focus trapping logic
