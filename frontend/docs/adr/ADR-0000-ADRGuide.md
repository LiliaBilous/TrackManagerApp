# ADR-0000: Architecture Decision Records Guide

## Context

The _Track Manager_ project is a single-developer frontend application built with Vue 3 (Composition API).  
As the project evolves and is subject to external code reviews, it becomes important to document key architectural decisions.

## Decision

We will maintain Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) using Markdown files in a dedicated directory (e.g., `/adr/`).

Each ADR will follow a consistent format:

- `Context`: What led to this decision ‚Äî business, technical, or organizational forces.
- `Decision`: A clear, active-voice statement of the decision made.
- `Rationale`: Why this decision was made over alternatives, with supporting arguments.
- `Status`: Whether the decision is `Proposed`, `Accepted`, `Superseded`, or `Deprecated`.
- `Consequences`: Expected outcomes ‚Äî positive and negative.

File names will follow the convention: `ADR-XXXX-title.md` where `XXXX` is a sequential number.  
ADRs will be version-controlled as part of the repository to ensure historical traceability.

## Rationale

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) help capture the reasoning behind critical technical and architectural choices.  
They improve traceability, facilitate understanding for other contributors and reviewers, and provide historical context for why certain decisions were made.

We considered not using ADRs, which would save short-term effort, but would create long-term ambiguity and hinder maintainability and collaboration.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

**Positive:**

- Transparent record of architecture and technical strategy
- Easier for reviewers and contributors to follow design rationale
- Promotes consistency and intentionality in development
- Supports future refactoring or redesign decisions

**Negative:**

- Requires discipline to document decisions regularly
- Initial time investment to write and maintain ADRs
- Can lead to document bloat if overused without clear purpose
